## Declaratively Rendering Earth in 3D: A Cesium+React+Webpack Demo

A sample application to accompany the **[Declaratively Rendering the Earth in 3D](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/declaratively-rendering-earth-in-3d)** blog series by Mark Erikson, demonstrating how to use the [Cesium.js 3D globe library](http://cesiumjs.org/) with React and Webpack.

This sample app demonstrates how to:

- Set up a basic React app that loads Cesium
- Configure Webpack for faster build times and deployment of an application that uses Cesium using DllPlugin for code splitting
- Use React components to declaratively control rendering of Cesium primitives through Cesium's imperative APIs


**Please feel free to discuss implementation questions in both issues and pull requests!**  I'm happy to talk about why I did things a certain way.
